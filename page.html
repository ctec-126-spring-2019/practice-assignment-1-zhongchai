                Hullo, my name is Zhong (June) Chai. I am a designer/illustrator who wants to learn how to code like a pro. Please don't hurt me.

            <p class="my-4">
                I would like to learn relevant skills to help me create nice-looking applications for a portfolio. Ideally they should demonstrate my abilities and combine my artistic skills with programming skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also very interested in learning various frameworks such as Angular and React, since I don't have much experience with them in the past.
            </p>

            <p class="my-4">
                Programming is currently something that I do occasionally to make some random apps for my personal use. I first became interested when I got a graphing calculator in middle school and found out that you could write basic programs on it. Even though I do not have a ton of experience with Javascript yet, it is probably the one that I will enjoy the most since it is so convenient to be able to run things quickly in a browser, not to mention that it's simple to create graphical interfaces for it too because of integration with HTML/CSS.
            </p>
            <p>Programming languages I have some experience with: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Are these considered programming languages too?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ul>
